I make 5 changes to it.

1, two "bouncing" boxes in map.

2, some pick ups float in air instead of fixing on ground. Players need to use incline or some other things to collect them.

3, a group of portals. Inspired by Portal/Portal2. Thank you Valve!

4, border setting. If the ball drops off the border by accident, it will be reset to (0,0,0).

5, a black hole. In the black area, the ball will be dragged towards the center. Use gravitation properly to reach your goal!
